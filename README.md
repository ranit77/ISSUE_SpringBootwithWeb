Whenever I am running the application it works perfectly fine on the console and prints the Home method() within Controller class.
I have tried to refresh the browser page multiple times to make sure the browser is actually calling the Home method and it actually does.
Below is the snippet for your reference:

However there is no change on the browser page.It still fails to load with the same error message.
**Error message:**
Whitelabel Error Page
This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.
